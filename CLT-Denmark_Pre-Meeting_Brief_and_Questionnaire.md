## CLT‑Denmark — Pre‑Meeting Brief and Questionnaire

Last updated: {{insert date}}

---

### Purpose

This brief sets expectations for our upcoming session and gathers key inputs in advance so we can tailor the demo, validate assumptions, and accelerate decisions. Please complete the short questionnaire and share requested files ideally 48 hours before the meeting.

---

### Meeting Overview

- **Duration**: 60 minutes
- **Format**: Live demo + working session
- **Goals**:
  - Align on success criteria for CLT‑Optimizer pilot
  - Validate current workflow and pain points with concrete examples
  - Review live validation on your sample IFC and preview quote generation
  - Agree on next steps, responsibilities, and timeline

---

### Agenda (proposed)

1. Quick intros and objectives (5 min)
2. Your current workflow and pain points (10 min)
3. Live demo: upload IFC → validation results → analysis snapshot (20 min)
4. Discussion: rules, exceptions, and KLH readiness (15 min)
5. Pilot scope, metrics, and timeline (10 min)

If you prefer adjustments, add comments directly in this file or reply by email.

### What to Prepare (ideally 48h before)

- **Sample IFC** (architect model; optional: latest MEP/electrical)
- **Project context**: building type, size, typical element count
- **1–2 recent validation issues** you encountered (screenshots or short notes)
- **Manufacturing rules** you want enforced (size limits, panel build‑ups, surface grades)
- **Position numbering examples** (one good, one problematic)
- Optional: **pricing ranges or structure** (to demo quote scenarios; detailed prices not required at this stage)

You can share files via our secure upload link or email. We’ll handle all data under confidentiality (see note below).

3) Internal QA (timing and effort)
- When do you run internal QA? [ ] post‑HSBcad  [ ] pre‑KLH  [ ] multiple points
- Typical time spent: ______ hours (small) / ______ hours (medium) / ______ hours (large)
- What is checked most often? __________________________________

4) Common Errors & Frequency

- Typical KLH review time today: ______ hours

6) Manufacturing Constraints (to codify)
- Max panel width: ______   Max length: ______   Max thickness: ______
- Valid panel build‑ups we should enforce (list or attach): _____________
- Surface quality grades used and when flipping is allowed: _____________

7) Position Numbering
- Current convention/pattern (brief): ___________________________
- Known pain points to avoid: __________________________________

8) Pricing & Quote Scenarios (optional for demo)
- How do you price today? [ ] rate cards  [ ] spreadsheet  [ ] per element  [ ] other
- Are basic/standard/premium scenarios relevant? [ ] yes  [ ] no  [ ] later

9) Security & Data Handling
- Any restrictions on data sharing/storage we should know? _____________

### What to Expect in the Session

- A focused demo using your sample IFC (if provided) or our example model
- Automatic validation across geometry and metadata (CLT‑specific rules)
- Clear presentation of issues with 3D highlighting and concise summaries
- Snapshot of analysis and early quote scaffolding (if pricing inputs allow)
- Discussion of “KLH‑ready” checks and what we’ll automate first

---

### Proposed Pilot Scope (for discussion)

- Duration: 6–8 weeks, 8–15 projects
- Focus: preliminary quote automation, CLT‑specific metadata validation, prioritized clash detection
- Success metrics:
  - Reduce preliminary quote time from 4–8 hours → ≤ 15 minutes
  - Cut internal QA time by ≥ 50%
  - Reduce KLH rework cycles by 50–80%
- Deliverables: validation reports, KLH‑readiness summary, version diffs, exportable PDFs/Excel

---

### Timeline & Next Steps (to confirm)

1) Pre‑read returned + sample IFC received → we tailor checks
2) Live session (this meeting) → align on rules, demo, finalize pilot scope
3) Week 1–2 → configure rules, connect pricing ranges, internal dry‑runs
4) Weeks 3–6 → pilot execution on live projects, weekly iteration
5) Wrap‑up → ROI review and decision on rollout
