## üéØ The Problem

### Current Workflow at CLT-Denmark (Typical Manufacturer)

#### Phase 1: Project Intake (Highly Variable)
**What they receive:**
- **Option A (95% of cases):** Tender materials
  - 2D plans (floor plans, elevations, sections)
  - 3D architect IFC file
  - MEP models (sometimes)
  - Structural calculations (sometimes)
  
- **Option B (5% of cases):** Minimal information
  - Just 2D sketches
  - Rough floor plans
  - Conceptual drawings

**Challenge:** Every project arrives differently, requiring custom assessment

#### Phase 2: Preliminary Quotation (Manual, Time-Intensive)
**What they need to calculate:**
1. Cubic meters of glulam (beams, columns)
2. Square meters of CLT panels (walls, floors, roofs)
3. Quantity of brackets and screws
4. Full solution design (how to build it)

**Current Process:**
- Manual takeoff from 2D/3D models
- Excel-based calculations
- Optimization for cost/quality (manual)
- Design delivery and assembly planning
- **Time:** 4-8 hours per preliminary quote
- **Problem:** Significant effort on projects that never proceed

#### Phase 3: Detailed Design (After Contract Signed)
**Step 1: Static Design**
- Load calculations using BIPSA113 4LK A1
- Structural verification
- Fire safety compliance
- Not always required (depends on project scope)

**Step 2: Production Drawings (HSBcad)** (Is this when CLT Denmark builds the first model?)
1. Import architect IFC + MEP IFC + electrical IFC
2. Adapt and coordinate all disciplines
3. **Internal QA in BIM Vision** [**PROCESS TBD - SEE QUESTIONS**]
   - Manual visual inspection for geometric clashes
   - Manual spot-checking of element properties
   - [**TIME & COMPREHENSIVENESS TBD**]
4. External review with architect/engineer
5. Update IFC based on feedback
6. Send to KLH and glulam provider
7. **KLH imports to their HSBcad** 
   - Designs cutouts/details for their specific tools
   - Performs SOME validation (extent unclear)
   - Does NOT perform comprehensive clash detection
   - Sends back errors found ‚Üí rework cycle begins
8. **Rework cycle(s)** [**FREQUENCY & TIME TBD - SEE QUESTIONS**]
   - Fix issues in HSBcad
   - Re-export and resend to KLH
   - Repeat until approved
9. **Final review by CLT-Denmark** (last chance to catch errors)
10. Approve for production

**Time:** 2-4 weeks per project (+ rework cycles if errors found)

#### Phase 4: Delivery & Assembly
- CLT-Denmark delivers 95% of projects with:
  - CLT elements
  - Glulam beams/columns
  - Screws and brackets
  - Complete assembly solution
- Often responsible for entire building construction

### Critical Pain Points Identified

#### 1. **Preliminary Quote Bottleneck** üî¥ HIGHEST IMPACT
   - **Problem:** 4-8 hours per quote, many projects never proceed
   - **Current Process:** Manual quantity takeoff from 2D/3D models ‚Üí Excel calculations ‚Üí pricing
   - **Cost:** Wasted engineering time on non-converting leads
   - **Impact:** Slow response time = lost competitive advantage
   - **Our Solution:** Instant preliminary quotes from IFC upload (5 minutes vs 4-8 hours)

#### 2. **Manual Quantity Takeoff Errors** üî¥ HIGH IMPACT
   - **Problem:** Manual counting of m¬≥ glulam, m¬≤ CLT, brackets from models
   - **Current Process:** Designer visually inspects model, manually extracts quantities
   - **Cost:** Human error in quantities = pricing mistakes
   - **Impact:** Under-quote = lost profit, over-quote = lost project
   - **Our Solution:** Automated quantity extraction from model data

#### 3. **Manual Clash Detection (CLT + Glulam)** üü° MEDIUM-HIGH IMPACT
   - **Problem:** Manual visual inspection in BIM Vision to find geometric clashes
   - **Current Process:** 
     - Export HSBcad design to IFC
     - Open in BIM Vision
     - Manually rotate around model looking for clashes between:
       - CLT panel vs CLT panel
       - Glulam beam/column vs CLT panel
       - Glulam vs Glulam
     - Takes [**TIME TBD - CLARIFY WITH CLT-DENMARK**]
   - **What Gets Missed:** Subtle clashes, overlapping elements in complex areas
   - **Cost:** Errors reach KLH or discovered on-site
   - **Impact:** Rework cycle with KLH (emails back and forth, redesign, resubmit)
   - **Our Solution:** Automated geometric clash detection with 3D highlighting of issues

#### 4. **Critical Metadata Validation Missing** üî¥ HIGH IMPACT  
   - **Problem:** No automated checks for element properties that cause production/site issues
   - **Current Process:** Manual spot-checking of properties in BIM Vision (inconsistent)
   - **Common Errors:**
     - **Position Numbers:** Wrong, duplicated, or nonsensical numbering
     - **Surface Quality:** Specified on wrong side of element (expensive if wrong)
     - **Element Classification:** Wall marked as Roof, Floor marked as Wall
     - **Panel Build-up:** Missing or invalid configuration
     - **Coating Specification:** Missing or incorrect
     - **Size Constraints:** Elements too large to manufacture
   - **Real Example:** Position numbers made no sense on delivered elements ‚Üí site delays
     - Workers couldn't match physical elements to assembly drawings
     - Had to manually identify each element on-site
     - Assembly sequence completely disrupted
   - **Cost:** 
     - **Wrong surface quality:** Must reorder entire element (expensive premium material wasted)
     - **Wrong position numbers:** Site delays, labor costs multiply
     - **Invalid sizes:** Production rejection, full redesign needed
   - **Impact:** On-site chaos, production rejections, expensive rework
   - **Our Solution:** Automated validation of ALL metadata against manufacturing rules

#### 5. **KLH Assumes Model is Correct** üü° MEDIUM IMPACT
   - **Problem:** KLH imports model into HSBcad and optimizes for production WITHOUT comprehensive validation
   - **Current Process:**
     - CLT-Denmark sends IFC to KLH
     - KLH imports to their HSBcad
     - KLH designs cutouts/details for THEIR specific tools
     - KLH performs SOME validation (not automated clash detection)
     - If errors found: Email CLT-Denmark ‚Üí "We cannot do this, ask client for approval or redesign"
   - **What KLH Finds:**
     - Geometric clashes between CLT elements
     - Clashes between glulam and CLT
     - Cutouts/openings that can't be manufactured with their tools
   - **Cost:** Back-and-forth email cycles, redesign time, project delays
   - **Impact:** [**REWORK TIME TBD - CLARIFY WITH CLT-DENMARK**]
   - **Our Solution:** "KLH-Ready" certification - catch errors BEFORE sending to KLH

#### 6. **Multi-Discipline Coordination** ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPACT UNCLEAR - NEEDS CLARIFICATION
   - **Problem:** [**TO BE CLARIFIED WITH CLT-DENMARK**]
   - **Questions:**
     - Do you check MEP/electrical models against CLT model?
     - If yes, when and how? (BIM Vision? HSBcad? Manual overlay?)
     - If no, who is responsible for these clashes?
     - How often are MEP clashes discovered on-site?
   - **Potential Solution:** Automated cross-discipline clash detection (CLT vs MEP vs Electrical)

#### 7. **Inconsistent Input Quality** üü¢ LOW IMPACT (but frustrating)
   - **Problem:** Projects arrive with varying levels of detail
   - **Cost:** Time spent requesting missing information
   - **Impact:** Delayed quote delivery
   - **Our Solution:** Clear checklist of what's needed for accurate quote

### Cost of Current Approach ‚ö†Ô∏è ESTIMATES - TO BE VALIDATED WITH CLT-DENMARK

**Per Project (Estimated):**
- **Preliminary Quote:** 4-8 hours @ ‚Ç¨75/hour = ‚Ç¨300-600

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigation

### Critical Risks

#### 1. **Speckle Competition Risk** üî¥ HIGH
**Risk:** Speckle builds similar features, commoditizes our product
**Likelihood:** Medium-High (they want to be "GitHub of construction")
**Impact:** Existential

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- ‚úÖ **Align with Speckle's vision:** We build on their platform, not compete
- ‚úÖ **Become a Speckle partner:** Official integration, co-marketing
- ‚úÖ **Focus on CLT niche:** Too specific for Speckle to prioritize
- ‚úÖ **Build proprietary validation logic:** Not just UI on Speckle API
- ‚úÖ **Contribute to Speckle ecosystem:** Make them successful = we're successful
- üìÖ **Action:** Reach out to Speckle partnerships team by February 2025

#### 2. **HSBcad Competition Risk** üü° MEDIUM
**Risk:** HSBcad sees us as threat, builds own validation or partners with competitor
**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** High (they have existing customer relationships)

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- ‚úÖ **Integration-first approach:** Make HSBcad better, not replace it
- ‚úÖ **Co-marketing opportunity:** "HSBcad + [Our Tool] = Complete Solution"
- ‚úÖ **Focus on post-design validation:** Different stage of workflow
- ‚úÖ **Partner discussions early:** Approach them as collaborator, not competitor
- üìÖ **Action:** Initiate HSBcad partnership conversation by March 2025

#### 3. **In-house Development Risk** üü° MEDIUM
**Risk:** Large manufacturers (KLH) build this internally

- ‚úÖ **Speed advantage:** Be 2-3 years ahead before they consider building
- ‚úÖ **Multi-manufacturer value:** Our tool works across their customers
- ‚úÖ **Continuous innovation:** Always stay ahead with new features
- ‚úÖ **White-label option:** Let them brand it as theirs if needed
- ‚úÖ **Cost advantage:** Cheaper to subscribe than build + maintain

#### 4. **Patent/IP Risk** üü¢ LOW

**Likelihood:** Low (software patents difficult in EU)
**Impact:** Medium

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Defensive publication:** Document our methods publicly (prior art)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Trade secrets:** Keep validation algorithms proprietary
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Speed to market:** Establish market position before patent wars
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Legal review:** Consult IP lawyer before major releases
- üìÖ **Action:** IP strategy review by April 2025

#### 5. **Market Adoption Risk** üü° MEDIUM
**Risk:** Industry too conservative, slow to adopt new tools
**Likelihood:** Medium (construction is traditional)
**Impact:** High (delays revenue)

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- ‚úÖ **Zero learning curve:** Works with existing tools (Speckle)
- ‚úÖ **Prove ROI first:** CLT-Denmark case study with hard numbers
- ‚úÖ **Free trial:** Let them see value before paying
- ‚úÖ **Champion-led sales:** Find internal advocates at each company
- ‚úÖ **Industry credibility:** Present at conferences, publish case studies
